<center><h2>Overview</h2></center>
<p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. 

Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so itâ€™s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).</span></p>

<center><h2>Is Covid the same in everyone?</h2></center>

<center>No - it can affect multiple organs and has several less common symptoms.

Scientists using data on the health of four million people say Covid has six sub-types.

Symptoms include:

<pre>
&#8226; Flu-like with no fever: Headache, loss of smell, muscle pains, cough, sore throat, chest pain, no fever
&#8226; Flu-like with fever: Headache, loss of smell, cough, sore throat, hoarseness, fever, loss of appetite
&#8226; Gastrointestinal: Headache, loss of smell, loss of appetite, diarrhoea, sore throat, chest pain, no cough
&#8226; Fatigue (severe level one): Headache, loss of smell, cough, fever, hoarseness, chest pain, fatigue
&#8226; Confusion (severe level two): Headache, loss of smell, loss of appetite, cough, fever, 
hoarseness, sore throat, chest pain, fatigue, confusion, muscle pain
&#8226; Abdominal and respiratory (severe level three): Headache, loss of smell, loss of appetite, cough, fever, 
hoarseness, sore throat, chest pain, fatigue, confusion, muscle pain, shortness of breath, diarrhoea, abdominal pain</pre>
Researchers think that vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal 
cramps could be a sign of coronavirus in children.</center>

<center><h2>Facts About Covid-19</h2></center>
<center><p>Sources: World Health Organization; GAVI , the Vaccine Alliance</p></center>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">COVID-19 vaccines were developed quickly while maintaining the highest safety standard possible</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>The need for a COVID-19 vaccine was urgent, so governments and companies spent much more money to develop it. Research and development took place at the same time around the world while still following strict safety and clinical standards. This allowed for faster vaccine development, but doesn't make the studies any less rigorous or the vaccine any less safe.</p>
</div></p>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Vaccines are thoroughly tested for safety before theyâ€™re made available to the public</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Vaccines go through extensive trials before they can be introduced in a country. Expert doctors and scientists follow strict international standards while deciding to make a vaccine available to the public. Like all medicines, vaccines may cause side effects that are usually minor and temporary. More serious side effects are extremely rare. A person is far more likely to be seriously harmed by a disease than by its vaccine.</p>
</div></p>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">COVID-19 vaccines can't give you COVID-19</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>You can't get COVID-19 from any of the vaccines. None of the vaccines available to the public contain the live virus that causes COVID-19. They may cause minor side effects such as a sore arm or mild fever. This is a sign that the vaccine is working.</p>
</div></p>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Vaccine side effects are usually mild</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Vaccines help protect the body from certain diseases. Like any medicine, they can cause minor, short-term side effects while the body adjusts them, such as a sore arm or a mild fever. More serious side effects are possible, but extremely rare. A person is far more likely to be seriously harmed by a disease than by its vaccine.</p>
</div></p>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Pneumonia vaccines don't prevent COVID-19</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>The COVID-19 virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Existing vaccines are highly recommended, however, to protect your health from pneumonia.</p>
</div></p>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Vaccine trials involve a diverse range of volunteers</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>In clinical trials, people volunteer to take and test the vaccine. These volunteers should be from diverse geographic areas, racial and ethnic backgrounds, genders, and ages. They should also include people with underlying health conditions that put them at higher risk for the disease. This helps ensure the vaccine is safe and effective for everyone.</p>
</div></p>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">You won't be able to make a COVID-19 vaccine at home</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Vaccine development is a complicated, technical process that can't be done at home. It involves extensive laboratory testing followed by clinical trials involving thousands of volunteers. Vaccines must be approved in a country by expert doctors and scientists.</p>
</div></p>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">COVID-19 vaccine trials are following safety and ethical standards</button>
<div class="content">
