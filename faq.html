<p>BASIC</p>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#10102; What is Covid-19</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. Most people with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, but some people can become severely ill. 
Although most people with COVID-19 get better within weeks of illness, some people experience post-COVID conditions. 
Post-COVID conditions are a wide range of new, returning, or ongoing health problems people can experience more than four weeks after first being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. Older people and those who have certain underlying medical conditions are more likely to get severely ill from COVID-19. 
Vaccines against COVID-19 are safe and effective.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#10103; Why is the disease being called coronavirus disease 2019, Covid-19 ?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus pandemic, first identified in Wuhan China. 
The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, “CO” stands for corona, “VI” for virus, and ”D” for disease. 
Formerly, this disease was referred to as “2019 novel coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV.”</p>
</div>

<p>SPREAD:</p>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#10102; How does the virus spread</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly through close contact from person to person, including between people who are physically near each other (within about 6 feet). People who are infected but do not show symptoms can also spread the virus to others. Cases of reinfection with COVID-19  have been reported but are rare. We are still learning about how the virus spreads and the severity of illness it causes.

COVID-19 spreads very easily from person to person. How easily a virus spreads from person to person can vary. The virus that causes COVID-19 appears to spread more efficiently than influenza but not as efficiently as measles, which is among the most contagious viruses known to affect people.

</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#10103; What is community spread</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected. Each health department determines community spread differently based on local conditions. </p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#10104; Can mosquitoes or ticks spread the virus that causes Covid-19</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks. The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person. </p>
</div>

<p>PREVENTION:</p>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#10102; Am I at risk for Covid-19 from mail, packages or product?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products, or packaging. However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#10103; Is it okay for me to donate blood?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>In healthcare settings across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients. The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations. CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19. CDC is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe. Examples of these recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#10104; Should I use soap and water or hand sanitizer to protect against Covid-19?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.</p>
</div>

<p>CHILDREN</p>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#10102; What is the risk of my child becoming sick with Covid-19?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Children can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 and can get sick with COVID-19. Most children with COVID-19 have mild symptoms or they may have no symptoms at all (“asymptomatic”). Fewer children have been sick with COVID-19 compared to adults. Babies younger than 1 and children with certain underlying medical conditions may be more likely to have serious illness from COVID-19. Some children have developed a rare but serious disease that is linked to COVID-19 called multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C).</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#10103; Should children wear masks?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>In general, children 2 years and older should wear a mask. However, CDC recognizes that wearing masks may not be possible in every situation or for some people. Appropriate and consistent use of masks may be challenging for some children, such as children with certain disabilities, including cognitive, intellectual, developmental, sensory and behavioral disorders. Learn more about what you should do if your child or you cannot wear masks in certain situations and special considerations for children who may have difficulties with techniques for improved fit and filtration.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#10104; Can my children spend time with older adults and people with chronic medical conditions?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Older adults and people who have certain underlying medical conditions are at increased risk for getting severely ill from COVID-19. To protect those who are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19, you may consider taking these extra precautions.
<pre>
&#10064; Separate your child from others in your household who have an increased risk for 
severe illness from COVID-19.

&#10064; Carefully consider who might be best to provide childcare if you are unable to care 
for your child (for example, you are not able to stay with your child while childcare 
or school is closed).

&#10064; Limit your child’s contact with other people if someone at higher risk for 
COVID-19 will be providing care (such as an older adult or someone with an 
underlying medical condition).

&#10064; Postpone visits or trips to see grandparents, older family members and family members 
who are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. 
Consider connecting virtually or by writing letters.</pre>
</div>


<p>SYMPTOMS AND EMERGENCY WARNING SIGNS</p>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#10102; What are the symptoms and complications that Covid-19 can cause? </button>
<div class="content">
  <p>People with COVID-19 have reported a wide range of symptoms – from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. If you have fever, cough, or other symptoms, you might have COVID-19.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#10103; Does someone need to be sick with flu or COVID-19 to be contagious?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>No. The CDC says most people can spread the flu and coronavirus for at least a day before they develop symptoms, but that people with coronavirus are thought to remain contagious for longer. People with the flu are most contagious in the first four days but can spread the virus for up to seven days after becoming sick. Coronavirus patients remain contagious for at least 10 days, even if their symptoms go away, according to the CDC.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#10104; When should I seek emergency care if I have Covid-19?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Look for emergency warning signs* for COVID-19. If someone is showing any of these signs, seek emergency medical care immediately

<pre>
&#10064; Trouble breathing

&#10064; Persistent pain or pressure in the chest

&#10064; New confusion

&#10064; Inability to wake or stay awake

&#10064; Pale, gray, or blue-colored skin, lips, or nail beds, depending on skin tone</pre></p>
</div>

<p>TESTING</p>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#10102; Is at-home specimen collection or testing available?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Yes. At-home testing and collection allow you to collect a specimen at home and either send it to a testing facility or preform the test at home.
You and your healthcare provider might consider either an at-home collection kit or an at-home test if you have signs and symptoms of COVID-19 or if you can’t get testing at a local healthcare facility.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#10103; Can someone test negative and later test positive on a viral test for Covid-19</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Yes, it is possible. You may test negative if the sample was collected early in your infection and test positive later during this illness. You could also be exposed to COVID-19 after the test and get infected then. 
Even if you test negative, you still should take steps to protect yourself and others.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#10104; Should I be tested for a current infection?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>The following should be tested for current infection

<pre>People who have symptoms of COVID-19.
&#10064;  Most people who have had close contact (within 6 feet for a total of 15 minutes
or more over a 24-hour period) with someone with confirmed COVID-19.

&#10064; Fully vaccinated people with no COVID-19 symptoms do not need to be tested 
following an exposure to someone with COVID-19.

&#10064; People who have tested positive for COVID-19 within the past 3 months and 
recovered do not need to get tested following an exposure as long as they do 
not develop new symptoms.

&#10064; People who have taken part in activities that put them at higher 
risk for COVID-19 because they cannot physically distance as needed 
to avoid exposure such as travel, attending large social or mass gatherings, 
or being in crowded or poorly-ventilated indoor settings.<pre></p>

<p>IF YOU OR SOMEONE YOU KNOW IS SICK OR HAD CONTACT WITH SOMEONE WHO HAS COVID-19</p>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#10102; What should I do if I gest sick or someone in my house gets sick?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>People who have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19—
excluding people who have had COVID-19 within the past 3 months or who are fully vaccinated
<pre>
&#10064; People who have tested positive for COVID-19 within the past 3 months and 
recovered do not have to quarantine or get tested again as long as they 
do not develop new symptoms.

&#10064; People who develop symptoms again within 3 months of their first about 
of COVID-19 may need to be tested again if there is no other cause 
identified for their symptoms.

&#10064; People who have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19 
are not required to quarantine if they have been fully vaccinated against 
the disease and show no symptoms.</pre></p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#10103; What are the recommendation for someone who has symptoms of Covid-19?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>If you are sick with COVID-19 or think you might have COVID-19, follow the steps below to care for yourself and to help protect other people in your home and community.

<pre>
&#10064; Stay at home (except to get medical care).

&#10064; Separate yourself from others.

&#10064; Monitor your symptoms.

<p>CONTACT TRACING</p>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#10102; What is contact tracing?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Contact tracing has been used for decades by state and local health departments to slow or stop the spread of infectious diseases.

Contact tracing slows the spread of COVID-19 by

<pre>
&#10064; Letting people know they may have been exposed to COVID-19 and should 
monitor their health for signs and symptoms of COVID-19

&#10064; Helping people who may have been exposed to COVID-19 get tested

&#10064; Asking people to self-isolate if they have COVID-19 or self-quarantine 
if they are a close contact of someone with COVID-19</pre>

<p>During contact tracing, the health department staff will not ask you for
<pre>
&#10064; Money

&#10064; Social Security number

&#10064; Bank account information

&#10064; Salary information

&#10064; Credit card numbers</pre></p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#10103; What will happen with my personal information during contact tracing?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Discussions with health department staff are confidential. This means that your personal and medical information will be kept private and only shared with those who may need to know, like your health care provider.

If you have been diagnosed with COVID-19, your name will not be shared with those you came in contact with. The health department will only notify people you were in close contact with that they might have been exposed to COVID-19. Each state and jurisdiction use their own method for collecting and protecting health information. To learn more, contact your state or local health department.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#10104; If I am a close contact, will I be tested for covid-19?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>If you have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19, you should be tested, even if you do not have symptoms of COVID-19. The health department may be able to provide resources for testing in your area.

For more information, see COVID-19 Contact Tracing.

Watch for or monitor your symptoms of COVID-19. If your symptoms worsen or become severe, you should seek medical care.</p>
</div>

<p>COMMUNITY MITIGATION</p>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#10102; What is community mitigation?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Community mitigation is a set of actions that people and communities can take to slow the spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19. The goal of community mitigation in areas with local COVID-19 transmission is to slow its spread and to protect all individuals, especially those at increased risk for severe illness, while minimizing the negative impacts of these strategies.</p>
</div>

<p>TRAVEL</p>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#10102; What if I can't maintain 6 feet of distance from others during travel?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Maintaining physical distance to prevent COVID-19 is often difficult on public transportation conveyances. People may not be able to distance themselves by the recommended minimum of 6 feet from other people seated nearby or those standing in or passing through the aisles on airplanes, trains, or buses.

Where physical distancing is difficult or impossible, it is essential that drivers, operators, and other transportation staff follow additional preventive measures, such as increasing ventilation and cleaning high-touch surfaces, and travelers should still take steps to protect themselves and others.

Transportation staff and eligible passengers can protect themselves by getting fully vaccinated. While getting vaccinated against COVID-19 is the top prevention strategy, those who are not fully vaccinated should follow guidance for unvaccinated people.

Wearing a mask over your nose and mouth is required on planes, buses, trains, and other forms of public transportation traveling into, within, or out of the United States, and while indoors at U.S. transportation hubs, such as airports and stations, even for those people who have been fully vaccinated.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#10103; Shoukd I delay going on a cruise?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>At this time, CDC still recommends people who are not fully vaccinated avoid any travel on cruise ships, including river cruises, worldwide, because the risk of COVID-19 on cruise ships is high. It is especially important that people who are not fully vaccinated and who are more likely to get severely ill avoid travel on cruise ships, including river cruises. Cruise passengers who are not fully vaccinated against COVID-19 are at increased risk, since the virus spreads person-to-person, and outbreaks of COVID-19 have been reported on cruise ships because of their congregate (group) settings where COVID-19 spreads easily.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#10104; Can flying on an airplane increase my risk of getting Covid-19?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Yes. Air travel requires spending time in security lines and airport terminals, which can bring you in close contact with other people and frequently touched surfaces. Most viruses and other germs do not spread easily on flights because of how air circulates and is filtered on airplanes. However, social distancing is difficult on crowded flights, and you may have to sit near others (within 6 feet), sometimes for hours. This may increase your risk for exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19.</p>
</div>

<p>TRANSMISSION</p>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#10102; What is someone infectious</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>The onset and duration of viral shedding and the period of infectiousness for COVID-19 are not yet known with certainty. Based on current evidence, scientists believe that persons with mild to moderate COVID-19 may shed replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 for up to 10 days following symptom onset, while a small fraction of persons with severe COVID-19, including immunocompromised persons, may shed replication-competent virus for up to 20 days. It is possible that SARS-CoV-2 RNA may be detectable in the upper or lower respiratory tract for weeks after illness onset, similar to infections with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. However, detection of viral RNA does not necessarily mean that infectious virus is present. Based on existing literature, the incubation period (the time from exposure to development of symptoms) of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses (e.g., MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV) ranges from 2–14 days.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#10103; Which body fluids can spread infection?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in upper and lower respiratory tract specimens, and SARS-CoV-2 virus has been isolated from upper respiratory tract specimens and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in blood and stool specimens, and SARS-CoV-2 virus has been isolated in cell culture from the stool of some patients, including a patient with pneumonia 15 days after symptom onset. The duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in upper and lower respiratory tract specimens and in extrapulmonary specimens is not yet known but may be several weeks or longer. Duration of several weeks or longer has been observed in cases of MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infection. While viable, infectious SARS-CoV has been isolated from respiratory, blood, urine, and stool specimens, viable, infectious MERS-CoV has only been isolated from respiratory tract specimens. It is not yet known whether other non-respiratory body fluids from an infected person including blood, vomit, urine, breast milk, or semen can contain viable, infectious SARS-CoV-2.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#10104; Can people who recover from Covid-19 be re-infected with SARS-Cov-2?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>CDC is aware of recent reports indicating that persons who were previously diagnosed with COVID-19 can be re-infected. These reports can understandably cause concern. The immune response, including duration of immunity, to SARS-CoV-2 infection is not yet understood. Based on what we know from other viruses, including common human coronaviruses, some reinfections are expected. Ongoing COVID-19 studies will help establish the frequency and severity of reinfection and who might be at higher risk for reinfection. At this time, whether you have had COVID-19 or not, the best ways to prevent infection are to wear a mask in public places, stay at least 6 feet away from other people, frequently wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, and avoid crowds and confined spaces.</p>
</div>

<p>RESPIRATORS</p>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#10102; What is a respirator</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>A respirator is a personal protective device that is worn on the face or head and covers at least the nose and mouth. A respirator is used to reduce the wearer’s risk of inhaling hazardous airborne particles (including infectious agents), gases or vapors. Respirators, including those intended for use in healthcare settings, are certified by the CDC/NIOSH</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#10103; What make N95 respirator different form facemasks (sometimes called a surgical mask) ?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
<pre>
&#10064; N95 respirators reduce the wearer’s exposure to airborne particles, from small 
particle aerosols to large droplets. N95 respirators are tight-fitting respirators
that filter out at least 95% of particles in the air, including large and small 
particles.

&#10064;  Not everyone is able to wear a respirator due to medical conditions that may be 
made worse when breathing through a respirator. Before using a respirator or getting 
fit-tested, workers must have a medical evaluation to make sure that they are able 
to wear a respirator safely.

&#10064; Achieving an adequate seal to the face is essential. United States regulations 
require that workers undergo an annual fit test and conduct a user seal check 
each time the respirator is used. Workers must pass a fit test to confirm a 
proper seal before using a respirator in the workplace.

&#10064; When properly fitted and worn, minimal leakage occurs around edges of the 
respirator when the user inhales. This means almost all of the air is directed 
through the filter media.

&#10064; Unlike NIOSH-approved N95s, facemasks are loose-fitting and provide only 
barrier protection against droplets, including large respiratory particles. 
No fit testing or seal check is necessary with facemasks. Most facemasks 
do not effectively filter small particles from the air and do not prevent 
leakage around the edge of the mask when the user inhales.

&#10064; The role of facemasks is for patient source control, to prevent 
contamination of the surrounding area when a person coughs or sneezes.  
Patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 should wear a facemask until 
they are isolated in a hospital or at home. The patient does not need to wear 
a facemask while isolated.</pre></p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#10104; Should I wear a respirator in public?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Most often, spread of respiratory viruses from person-to-person happens among close contacts (within 6 feet). Recent studies indicate that people who are infected but do not have symptoms likely also play a role in the spread of COVID-19. CDC recommends everyday preventive actions to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, such as avoiding people who are sick, avoiding touching your eyes or nose, and covering your cough or sneeze with a tissue. People who are sick should stay home and not go into crowded public places or visit people in hospitals. Workers who are sick should follow CDC guidelines and stay home when they are sick.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#10105; What can I do if employeess complain that surgical N95 respirators are hot and uncomfortable.</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>The requirements for surgical N95 respirators that make them resistant to high velocity streams of body fluids and help protect the sterile field can result in a design that has a higher breathing resistance (makes it more difficult to breath) than a typical N95 respirator. Also, surgical N95 respirators are designed without exhalation valves which are sometimes perceived as warmer inside the mask than typical N95 respirators. If you are receiving complaints, you may consider having employees who are not doing surgery, not working in a sterile field, or not potentially exposed to high velocity streams of body fluids wear a standard N95 with an exhalation valve.</p>
