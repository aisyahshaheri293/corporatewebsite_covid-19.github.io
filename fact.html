<p><b>&#8226; Vaccines are thoroughly tested for safety before they’re made available to the public</b></p>
  <p>Vaccines go through extensive trials before they can be introduced in a country. 
Expert doctors and scientists follow strict international standards while deciding 
to make a vaccine available to the public. 
Like all medicines, vaccines may cause side effects that are usually minor and temporary. 
More serious side effects are extremely rare. 
A person is far more likely to be seriously harmed by disease than by its vaccine.

<p><b>&#8226; COVID-19 vaccines were developed quickly while maintaining the highest safety standard possible</p></b>
  <p>The need for a COVID-19 vaccine was urgent, so governments and companies spent much more money to develop it. Research and development took place at the same time around the world while still following strict safety and clinical standards. This allowed for faster vaccine development but doesn't make the studies any less rigorous or the vaccine any less safe.

<p><b>&#8226; Vaccine side effects are usually mild</p></b>
  <p>Vaccines help protect the body from certain diseases. Like any medicine, they can cause minor, short-term side effects while the body adjusts them, such as a sore arm or a mild fever. More serious side effects are possible, but extremely rare. A person is far more likely to be seriously harmed by disease than by its vaccine.

<p><b>&#8226; Vaccine trials involve a diverse range of volunteers</p></b>
  <p>In clinical trials, people volunteer to take and test the vaccine. These volunteers should be from diverse geographic areas, racial and ethnic backgrounds, genders, and ages. They should also include people with underlying health conditions that put them at higher risk for the disease. This helps ensure the vaccine is safe and effective for everyone.

<p><b>&#8226; When properly worn, medical masks won't make you breathe in too little oxygen or too much carbon dioxide</p></b>
  <p>Medical masks, also known as surgical masks, are flat or pleated masks that attach to the head with straps or loops. Medical masks may feel uncomfortable if worn for a long time, but they won't make you breathe in too little oxygen or too much carbon dioxide.

  <p>Garlic is a healthy food that may kill some microbes, but there is no evidence that it protects people from COVID-19. The best way to protect yourself from COVID-19 is to keep a safe distance from others and clean your hands frequently and thoroughly.

<p><b>&#8226; Mosquito bites don't spread COVID-19</p></b>
  <p>There is no evidence to suggest that COVID-19 can spread through mosquito bites. COVID-19 spreads mainly through droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks. It can also spread if you touch an infected surface and then touch your eyes, nose or mouth. To protect yourself, clean your hands often and disinfect frequently touched surfaces at home.

<p><b>&#8226; It's very unlikely that shoes spread COVID-19</p></b>
  <p>The likelihood of COVID-19 being spread by shoes is very low. As an extra safety step, consider leaving your shoes at the entrance of your home, particularly if infants or small children play on the floors. This will prevent contact with dirt or waste from the soles of shoes.

  <p>Being able to hold your breath for 10 seconds or more without coughing or feeling discomfort does not mean you are free from COVID-19 or any other lung disease. The best way to confirm if you have the COVID-19 virus is through a laboratory test.
